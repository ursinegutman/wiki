# The Three System Properties

## Overview

Panarchy theory identifies three fundamental properties that determine how complex systems behave, how they move through adaptive cycles, and whether they will prove resilient or vulnerable to disturbance. These three properties—**potential**, **connectedness**, and **resilience**—interact to create the characteristic dynamics of the adaptive cycle's four phases (r, K, Omega, Alpha). Understanding these properties provides a framework for analyzing any system, from forests to farms to civilizations, revealing where vulnerabilities are emerging and what kinds of changes are possible.

For collapse-aware agriculture, the three system properties offer diagnostic tools for assessing our current food system and designing alternatives. Industrial agriculture maximizes potential (incredible productive capacity) and connectedness (global integration, tight dependencies) while minimizing resilience (little capacity to absorb disturbance without catastrophic change). This configuration—high potential, high connectedness, low resilience—characterizes the K phase and creates maximum vulnerability to Omega-phase collapse. Designing resilient agricultural systems requires different balances: maintaining enough potential to be productive, enough connectedness to function efficiently, but enough resilience to absorb the disturbances that are inevitable in our changing world.

## Potential

### Definition and Components

**Potential** is the number of possible future states available to a system, determined by the accumulated resources that can be recombined in various ways. Potential includes (Holling, 2001):

- **Accumulated capital**: Biomass in ecosystems, infrastructure and equipment in human systems, financial capital in economies
- **Knowledge and information**: Genetic information, cultural knowledge, technical expertise
- **Resources available for recombination**: Nutrients in soil, seeds in seed banks, human skills and capacities

Potential is highest in the Alpha and early r phases, when resources are available but haven't yet been organized into fixed configurations. A forest immediately after fire has high potential: many different species combinations could establish depending on conditions, seed sources, and chance events. An abandoned field being colonized by pioneer species has high potential: it could become forest, grassland, shrubland, or remain in various successional states depending on management and environmental conditions (Gunderson and Holling, 2002).

Potential declines through the r and K phases as resources become organized into specific configurations. An old-growth forest has lower potential than a recently burned forest because the established trees, understory plants, and soil organisms create constraints on what can develop next. The old-growth forest will likely regenerate as old-growth forest after disturbance (high continuity), whereas the burned forest has multiple possible developmental pathways (lower continuity, higher potential).

### Potential in Agricultural Systems

Agricultural potential includes:

- **Soil resources**: Organic matter, nutrient availability, microbial diversity, soil structure
- **Genetic resources**: Crop varieties, livestock breeds, soil organism diversity
- **Knowledge resources**: Farmer expertise, seed saving knowledge, understanding of local conditions
- **Infrastructure resources**: Irrigation systems, storage facilities, processing equipment, market access

Industrial agriculture has very high potential in some dimensions (incredible capacity to produce food when conditions are favorable) but low potential in others (minimal genetic diversity, little farmer knowledge of low-input methods, degraded soil resources in many regions). This imbalance creates vulnerability: the system can produce enormously when conditions are right, but has minimal capacity to adapt when conditions change (Walker et al., 2004).

Traditional and regenerative agricultural systems often have lower immediate productive potential but higher adaptive potential: diverse crop varieties that can respond to varying conditions, soil organic matter that buffers against drought, farmer knowledge of multiple production methods. This adaptive potential becomes crucial during disturbances when highly optimized systems fail.

### Managing Potential

Potential management requires balancing different kinds of potential:

**Productive potential**: The capacity to produce desired outputs under favorable conditions. This is what K-phase optimization maximizes—selecting the highest-yielding varieties, applying optimal fertilizer rates, managing for maximum productivity.

**Adaptive potential**: The capacity to maintain functions under varying conditions. This requires diversity, redundancy, and buffers that reduce immediate productivity but increase capacity to respond to disturbance (Díaz et al., 2013).

**Transformative potential**: The capacity to reorganize into fundamentally different configurations when conditions change beyond the range that current adaptations can handle. This requires maintaining "excess" resources that don't appear necessary during stable conditions but enable transformation during crisis.

For collapse-aware agriculture, maintaining adaptive and transformative potential is more important than maximizing productive potential. This means preserving soil organic matter (adaptive potential), maintaining diverse crop varieties and livestock breeds (transformative potential), and supporting farmer knowledge of multiple production methods (adaptive and transformative potential) even when more narrowly optimized approaches appear more productive.

## Connectedness

### Definition and Dynamics

**Connectedness** is the degree to which system components regulate and control each other. Connectedness determines how tightly the system's components are coupled and how rapidly changes or disturbances propagate through the system (Holling, 2001).

**Low connectedness**: Components function relatively independently. Disturbances affecting one component don't rapidly spread to others. Innovation and experimentation can occur without affecting the entire system. Examples include early successional forests with loose plant associations, traditional farming systems with diverse independent components, or local economies with many small businesses rather than concentrated corporations.

**High connectedness**: Components tightly regulate each other. Changes in one component rapidly affect others. The system becomes efficient and coordinated but vulnerable to cascading failure. Examples include old-growth forests with complex mutualisms, industrial monocultures with uniform genetics and synchronized management, or global supply chains where disruption in one region affects worldwide markets (Gunderson and Holling, 2002).

Connectedness increases through the r and K phases as systems develop more structure and interactions. It peaks in the K phase, where systems appear most stable but are actually most vulnerable to disturbances that propagate through highly connected networks.

### Types of Connectivity

Connectivity operates through multiple pathways that need to be distinguished:

**Functional connectivity**: Interactions through which components affect each other's function. Plants competing for water, predators regulating prey populations, markets linking producers and consumers. Some functional connectivity creates stability (negative feedbacks that maintain balance), while some creates vulnerability (positive feedbacks that amplify change).

**Structural connectivity**: Physical connections that link components. Mycorrhizal networks connecting plants, drainage systems linking hydrological units, transportation networks linking markets. Structural connectivity enables functional connectivity but isn't the same as it.

**Institutional connectivity**: Formal and informal rules, norms, and organizations that link components. Water user associations that coordinate irrigation, supply contracts that link farmers to processors, agricultural extension services that link research to practice (Folke et al., 2005).

Each type of connectivity can create both stability and vulnerability depending on its structure and dynamics. The key question is not whether connectivity exists but how it's organized and whether it enables adaptive response or creates rigidity.

### Connectedness in Agricultural Systems

Agricultural connectedness has increased dramatically through industrialization:

- **Genetic connectivity**: Uniform crop varieties and livestock breeds create vulnerability to pests and diseases that affect all individuals similarly
- **Input connectivity**: Dependence on specific fertilizer, pesticide, and seed suppliers creates vulnerability when supply chains are disrupted
- **Market connectivity**: Integration into global markets creates dependence on distant economic conditions and transportation systems
- **Information connectivity**: Dependence on external expertise and recommendations reduces local adaptive capacity

Some traditional agricultural systems also had high connectedness, but it was organized differently: irrigation farmer associations that coordinated water distribution but maintained local autonomy, seed exchange networks that shared genetic resources while maintaining local adaptation, community labor exchange that provided seasonal labor without creating permanent dependencies (Netting, 1993).

**Managing connectivity appropriately** requires finding the right balance: enough connectivity to enable coordination and efficiency, but not so much that systems become rigid and vulnerable. For collapse-aware agriculture, this might mean:

- Regional seed systems that share genetic resources while maintaining local adaptation
- Watershed-scale water management that coordinates large-scale infrastructure while maintaining local flexibility
- Local food systems that participate in broader markets without depending on them for essential needs

## Resilience

### Defining Resilience

**Resilience** is the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance and reorganize while undergoing change so as to still retain essentially the same function, structure, identity, and feedbacks (Walker et al., 2004). It's not about bouncing back to some previous state (that's engineering resilience: how fast a system returns to equilibrium after disturbance) but about continuing to provide essential functions even as the system's specific configuration changes.

Ecological resilience (the original concept developed by Holling) refers to the amount of disturbance a system can absorb before it shifts into a different state. A lake has high resilience if it can absorb nutrient loading, algae blooms, and fish kills without shifting from a clear-water macrophyte-dominated state to a turbid algae-dominated state. It has low resilience if a small additional nutrient input triggers this regime shift (Scheffer et al., 2001).

For agriculture, resilience means maintaining food production capacity despite disturbances: drought, pest outbreaks, market disruptions, input shortages, climate change. A resilient agricultural system might change its specific crops, methods, or organization in response to disturbance but would continue to provide food and livelihoods.

### Resilience's Components

Resilience emerges from multiple system properties:

**Diversity**: Genetic, species, and functional diversity provides redundancy (multiple components performing similar functions) and response diversity (different components responding differently to disturbance, ensuring some maintain function under any conditions) (Elmqvist et al., 2003). Traditional crop polycultures maintain production when some varieties fail because others succeed; modern monocultures fail entirely when their single variety fails.

**Modularity**: Loose connections between system components create modularity, where failures can be contained rather than cascading. A modular food system with many regional production centers can absorb failure in one region without system-wide collapse. A highly integrated global food system has minimal modularity, creating vulnerability to cascading failure (Cumming et al., 2005).

**Buffers**: Resources that can be drawn on during disturbance provide buffering capacity. Soil organic matter buffers against drought by storing water; diverse seed stocks buffer against crop failure; community networks buffer against economic shock. K-phase optimization often eliminates buffers to increase efficiency, creating vulnerability (Gunderson and Holling, 2002).

**Tight feedbacks**: Rapid feedback enables adaptive response before small problems become large. When farmers directly observe consequences of their actions and can adjust quickly, systems adapt and maintain function. When feedbacks are delayed or indirect (as when distant supply chains or regulatory systems intervene), adaptive capacity declines (Berkes and Folke, 1998).

**Ecological memory**: The legacy of past disturbances—seeds in soil, adaptive traits, cultural knowledge of past variability—provides resources for responding to new disturbances. Systems with long continuity at place typically have greater ecological memory than recently established systems (Folke et al., 2005).

### Resilience's Trade-offs

Resilience often trades off with efficiency and productivity:

- **Efficiency-resilience trade-off**: Maximizing efficiency typically reduces redundancy, diversity, and buffers that provide resilience. Just-in-time supply chains are highly efficient but vulnerable to disruption. Diverse local production systems are less efficient but more resilient.

- **Productivity-resilience trade-off**: Maximizing short-term productivity often reduces long-term resilience. Monocultures producing maximum yields this season reduce genetic diversity that would buffer against future pests and diseases.

- **Control-resilience trade-off**: Tight control creates predictability but reduces adaptive capacity. Intensive pest management using pesticides creates predictable short-term control but reduces natural enemy populations that would provide long-term buffering (Walker et al., 2004).

These trade-offs mean that resilience cannot be maximized simultaneously with other desirable properties. Instead, systems must find appropriate balances for their contexts. For collapse-aware agriculture, this typically means accepting some efficiency and productivity costs to maintain resilience that will be essential during disturbances.

### Resilience Assessment

Assessing resilience requires examining:

1. **How close is the system to thresholds?**: What disturbances might trigger regime shifts? How far is the system from these thresholds? This requires understanding slow variables (soil organic matter, biodiversity, groundwater levels) that indicate system condition (Carpenter et al., 2001).

2. **What is the system's adaptive capacity?**: How much diversity, modularity, and buffering capacity does the system have? Can components reorganize in response to disturbance while maintaining function?

3. **What are the feedback dynamics?**: Are feedbacks tight and rapid or delayed and indirect? Can the system adapt before small disturbances become large ones?

4. **What is the cross-scale structure?**: How do fast and slow variables interact? Are there multiple scales of organization that can provide backup if one scale fails?

For agricultural systems, this might mean monitoring soil organic matter (slow variable), maintaining diverse crop varieties (response diversity), preserving local knowledge (tight feedbacks), and supporting household, community, and regional production capacity (multiple scales).

## The Three Properties Together

### System Coordinates in Property Space

The three properties (potential, connectedness, resilience) can be visualized as axes in a three-dimensional space, with each phase of the adaptive cycle occupying different regions (Holling, 2001):

**Alpha phase**: Low potential (resources have been released), low connectedness (loose organization), high resilience (many possible arrangements)

**r phase**: High potential (abundant resources available for capture), moderate connectedness (increasing structure but still flexible), high resilience (ability to absorb disturbance and continue growth)

**K phase**: High potential (accumulated capital), high connectedness (tight organization and control), low resilience (little capacity to absorb disturbance without changing)

**Omega phase**: Low potential (resources being released), low connectedness (previous connections breaking), variable resilience (may reorganize into similar or very different states)

This property-space mapping reveals the adaptive cycle's dynamics: as systems grow from Alpha through r to K, they accumulate potential and connectedness while losing resilience. Omega releases potential and connectedness, opening possibilities for Alpha-phase reorganization that may have high or low resilience depending on available resources and conditions (Gunderson and Holling, 2002).

### Industrial Agriculture in Property Space

Industrial agriculture's position in property space reveals its vulnerabilities:

- **Very high potential**: Enormous productive capacity when conditions are favorable
- **Very high connectedness**: Global integration, tight dependencies, uniform varieties
- **Very low resilience**: Minimal buffering capacity, little redundancy, rapid cascading possible

This configuration—maximizing potential and connectedness while minimizing resilience—characterizes late K-phase systems and creates maximum vulnerability to Omega-phase collapse. The high yields and apparent stability are misleading indicators; they represent K-phase dynamics that typically precede collapse rather than indicating that collapse can be avoided (Walker and Salt, 2006).

### Alternative Agricultural Configurations

Collapse-aware agriculture suggests alternative positions in property space:

- **Moderate potential**: Accepting somewhat lower yields to maintain adaptive capacity
- **Moderate connectedness**: Regional coordination without global dependency, local flexibility within broader networks
- **High resilience**: Diversity, redundancy, and buffers that enable absorption of disturbance

This configuration would provide less spectacular productivity under favorable conditions but much greater capacity to maintain function across the wide range of conditions likely in coming decades. It represents moving away from K-phase optimization toward a more balanced position that acknowledges back-loop dynamics rather than assuming front-loop permanence.

## Collapse-Aware Perspective

### System Vulnerabilities

The three properties framework reveals agricultural vulnerabilities:

1. **Potential imbalances**: High productive potential with low adaptive potential creates systems that perform brilliantly when conditions are right but fail catastrophically when conditions change.

2. **Excessive connectedness**: Tight coupling of components creates vulnerability to cascading failure, where disturbances that should be localized become systemic.

3. **Low resilience**: Elimination of redundancy, diversity, and buffers to increase efficiency reduces capacity to absorb disturbance without regime shift.

4. **Property rigidity**: Systems locked into specific property configurations (high potential, high connectedness, low resilience) resist adaptive change, increasing vulnerability when conditions require transformation.

### Historical Precedents

Historical agricultural collapses show property dynamics:

1. **Mesopotamian salinization**: High potential (irrigation-enabled production) + high connectedness (state-managed irrigation) + low resilience (dependence on continuous irrigation) → vulnerability when salinization reduced soil capacity

2. **Maya collapse**: High potential (intensive agriculture) + high connectedness (integrated regional systems) + low resilience (minimal buffering against drought) → vulnerability when multi-year drought struck

3. **Dust Bowl**: High potential (plow-enabled expansion) + high connectedness (market-integrated production) + low resilience (degraded soil structure) → vulnerability when drought exposed soil loss

Each case shows K-phase configurations (high potential and connectedness, low resilience) creating vulnerability to Omega-phase disturbance.

### Post-Collapse Relevance

For collapse-aware agriculture, the three properties suggest:

1. **Assess current position**: Where are specific agricultural systems in property space? What vulnerabilities does this create?

2. **Target different positions**: Move away from extreme K-phase positions toward more balanced configurations that maintain resilience.

3. **Build specific properties**: Increase resilience through diversity, redundancy, and buffers; moderate connectedness to reduce cascading vulnerability; maintain adaptive potential alongside productive potential.

4. **Monitor thresholds**: Track slow variables (soil organic matter, biodiversity) that indicate proximity to thresholds where resilience is lost and regime shifts become likely.

### Resilience Strategies

Three-properties-informed strategies include:

1. **Diversify at multiple scales**: Genetic diversity within crops, species diversity within farms, functional diversity across landscapes

2. **Build modularity**: Create semi-independent system components that can function separately if connections fail

3. **Maintain buffers**: Soil organic matter, stored resources, social networks that can absorb disturbance

4. **Tighten feedbacks**: Ensure farmers observe consequences and adapt quickly rather than depending on distant management

## Practical Applications

### Applying Property Analysis

The three properties framework transforms agricultural assessment:

1. **Map system position**: Where are specific systems in potential-connectedness-resilience space? What phase does this indicate?

2. **Identify vulnerabilities**: What kinds of disturbances would this configuration be vulnerable to? What thresholds might trigger regime shifts?

3. **Guide interventions**: What changes in properties would increase resilience without sacrificing essential potential? How can connectedness be organized to enable coordination without creating rigidity?

### Diagnostic Questions

For any agricultural system, ask:

- **Potential**: What resources are available? What kinds of reorganization are possible? Are we maintaining adaptive potential or just productive potential?

- **Connectedness**: How tightly are components coupled? Would failure in one component cascade? Is connectivity organized for adaptive response or rigid control?

- **Resilience**: What disturbances can the system absorb? What thresholds might trigger regime shift? What buffers, diversity, and feedbacks maintain function?
